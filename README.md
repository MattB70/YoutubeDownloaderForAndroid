# YoutubeDownloaderForAndroid

YouTubeDownloader by Matt Borle

Unfinished AnrdoidStudio project.

YouTube videos are streamed using two separate audio and video streams.
It is possible to download these streams and combine them into a single
.mp4 file for saving. I would have loved to finish this project, but it
is outside of the scope of my ability, as well as the scope of the project.
I've put roughly 30 hours into this project which includes research and plenty
of hair pulling. The documented code may make sense, but it's entirely possible
that it's become such a mess that nobody but me can make out what I was trying
to do. While this doesn't work, I hope it shows that I did play a part in this
project, even if my part never gets seen. I have to put some focus in my MATH221
course I'm currently failing. Hopefully we have something to present on Wednesday,
but I haven't heard or seen anything from the other group members aside from Edwin.
Let's hope I didnâ€™t have 4 people on my shoulders this whole time, because that's
going to be one hell of a let down.

Links to all resources I currently had open across the 4 Firefox windows are also
included if you happen to be interested in what I was trying to do.
Documented code as well as the rest of the project is included.
